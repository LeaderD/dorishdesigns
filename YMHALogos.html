                    <h3> OBJECTIVE </h3>
                    <p> To create logos that represent the values and projects started by the Youth Mental Health Association. Limitations included the use of symbols and green colour palette.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div id="YMHAoutcome">
                    <h3> OUTCOME </h3>
                    <p> Each logo was individually made while considering the diverse projects that the Youth Mental Health Association is a part of. Logos also were kept consistent with a similar look and elements. </p>

               <p> <b>Project Intersect </b> aims to bring mental health advocates for social gatherings to discuss mental health and participate in activities to promote healthy living. The logo is an intersecting origami star that represents individuals from different parts of life coming together to one place. The intersecting nature is to represent how one person can impact another, causing a chain reaction. </p>
               </div>
               <div> 
               <img src="portfolio/YMHAWork/ProjectInnovate.jpg"/>
               <p> <b>Project Innovate </b> involves the development of concepts surrounding the work of YMHA by using technology, big data and policy development. The gear in the logo is a common motif of technology, but implies that it is part of a larger system to function. The light bulb represents new ideas through collaboration and working with one another. </p>
               </div>
               <div>
               <img src="portfolio/YMHAWork/ProjectInquire.jpg"/>
               <p> <b>Project Inquire </b> involves the collaboration with high school clubs to raise mental health awareness. These collaborations involve featuring organizations, speakers, interactive booths and more. As this initiative involves raising awareness, a magnifying glass was used to represent a search for answers.  </p>

               <div>
               <img src="portfolio/YMHAWork/ProjectInteract.jpg"/>
               <p> <b>Project Interact </b> provides connection to students to organizations such as BC Pets and Friends and mental health high school clubs. These collaborative sessions provide fun and interaction to provide support to students. The two hands in the logo are to represent how people can help one another, and the interactive aspect of the initiative. </p>
